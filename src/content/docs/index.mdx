## Why Lore?

Lore saves all your AI coding sessions from Claude Code, Codex, etc and links them to commits. When you look at code later, you can see the conversation that produced it.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Capture" icon="pencil">
    Import sessions from Claude Code, Aider, Gemini CLI, and more. Run the daemon for real-time capture.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Link" icon="random">
    Connect AI sessions to git commits. See which conversation produced any commit.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Search" icon="magnifier">
    Full-text search across all your AI conversations. Find that solution you discussed months ago.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Blame" icon="information">
    Trace any line of code back to the AI session that created it.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
